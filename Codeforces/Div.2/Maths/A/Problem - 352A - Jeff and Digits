// from Codeforces Round #204 (Div. 2)
// some helpfull talk 
// the idea here is that to have a number that is divisible by 90 the number must be divisible by 10 and 9 
// or for general divisible by the factors or ant two numbers that them multiplication get us 90 but the most easy two numbers to check is 10 and 9 
// cuz any other numbers will lead us to say how I determine  that my given number is divisible by  that 
// but the 10 is so easy it just need to have at least one zero at last of it
// and the 9 have it`s  own trick which is the summation of the digits that make our number is divisible by 9
//so to be divisible by 10
//the number must have at least one 0 at it`s last digit and to be divisible 
//by 9 the digits that  construct the number it`s summation must be divisible by 9
//and in the case if 5`s here the number of 5`s that is divisible by 9 mean that it`s summation is divisible by 9
// we don`t care about puting zeros between 5`s cuz puting them always at the right most digits make the number bigger 
// and for any other state to get number of 5`s and 0`s between divisible by 9 you must have the summation of them divisible
//by 9 which mean you will just count the 5`s cuz 0`s will not affect at the summation so son`t count them 
//and any number of zeros in the right least digits don`t affect the divisibility of the number by 9 or 10
// there is more and more tricks about the divisibility by numbers you can look for it at google there is also pdf book for it at googel
