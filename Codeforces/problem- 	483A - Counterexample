// we assumed that tell "r" that is the range we could put a number from it to be the third number 
// if the l was odd we increase it to be even cuz when the first number is even then the second number be odd then the thid onw will be even so 
// that make us sure that the first even and the third even have a common devisor which is 2 at least so the first and the thirs is not co-prime
