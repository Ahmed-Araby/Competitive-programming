// U can look for the 2-bit adder photo in google to know that the part of it that produce the sum without the carry is X-or gate 
// but at a circuit of 2-bit adder how we could know that this the result is minus result ?????
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int n , x , mask=0;
    while(cin>>n>>x)
    {

        cout<<mask<< endl;
    }
