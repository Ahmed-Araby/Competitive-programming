# arrays and strings interview Questions from cracking the coding interview book

## helpful question for more clarification about the problem
* character set 
  * unicode 
  * asci 
  * extended asci
* case sensitivity
* space behaviour respect to other character (ignore space, match spce with any character).
* 


## notes
* nice bit manipulation
  * to check if some number has only 1 bit set ( (num-1) & num ) should equal 0, ex
     num = 0000100, num-1= 0000011 so anding will result in zero.
